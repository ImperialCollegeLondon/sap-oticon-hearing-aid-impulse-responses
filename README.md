# SAP-Oticon hearing aid impulse responses
This repository contains code for post-processing a database of impulse response measurements made in collaboration between the Speech and Audio Processing Lab at Imperial College and Oticon A/S in Copenhagen. The raw measurements are published as doi [].

The code provided here is used to generate processed versions which are suitable for various applications. A single matlab script, `run.m', contains paths which should be edited according to your local installation and can be configured to determine which post-processed versions of the database should be created.

If you use the database in its published form or modify this code to obtain an alternative version, we kindly ask that you cite
